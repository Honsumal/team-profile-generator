# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This application is a team profile generator that works from the command line. Using user input, it creates short profiles of employees with their name, ID, and email. Engineers also have an addtional input for their Github username, Interns have an input for their school, and Managers have an input for their office number. These profiles are printed onto a HTML document located in the dist folder. The application also automatically checks to ensure that the input it valid, and asks the user to confirm adding the new team member so that the user can cancel an input if they have made an error. This application provides a manager with a simple but well presented profile to display important information about the team they have built.
